# Fibonacci Series

### Algorithm
```md
STEP 1: START
STEP 2: Scan the range of the fibonacci series
STEP 3: for i <- 1 to range+1, print the fibonacci series, then goes to STEP 4
STEP 4: if range == 1, goes to STEP 7
STEP 5: if range == 2, goes to STEP 8
STEP 6: Return: Series(range - 1) + Series(range - 2), then goes to STEP 9
STEP 7: Return: 0, then goes to STEP 9
STEP 8: Return: 1, then goes to STEP 9
STEP 9: END
```
