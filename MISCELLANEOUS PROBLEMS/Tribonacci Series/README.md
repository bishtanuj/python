# Tribonacci Series

### Algorithm
```md
STEP 1: START
STEP 2: Scan the range of the tribonacci series.
STEP 3: for i <-1 to range+1, print series, then goes to STEP 4
STEP 4: If range == 1 or range == 2 goes to STEP 7 
STEP 5: If range == 3 goes to STEP 8
STEP 6: Return: series(range-1) + series(range-2) + series(range-3) then goes to STEP 9
STEP 7: Return 0 then goes to STEP 9
STEP 8: Return 1 then goes to STEP 9
STEP 9: END
```
