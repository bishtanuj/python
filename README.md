## What is Python?
Python is widely-used, interpreted, object-oriented, and high-level programming language with dynamic semantics, used for general-purpose programming.
And while you know the python as a large snake, the name of teh Python programming language comes from an old BBC television comedy sketch series called <b>Monty Python's Flying Circus</b>
As the height of this success, the Monty Python team were performing their sketches to live audiences across the world, including at the Hollywood Bowl.
Since Monty Python is considered one of the two fundamental nutrients to a programmer (the other being pizza), Python's creater named the language in honour of the TV show.
