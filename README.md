## A bit about Python
1. Python was created by ***GUIDO VAN ROSSUM***, Dutch Programmer in 1991.
2. Python was first released on 20th February, 1991.
3. Python is an Object-Oriented Programming Language.
4. Python is an Open-Source Programming Language.
5. Python is an Interpreted Language.
6. Python is a High-Level Language.
7. Python is portable.

## What is Python?
Python is widely-used, interpreted, object-oriented, and high-level programming language with dynamic semantics, used for general-purpose programming.
And while you know the python as a large snake, the name of teh Python programming language comes from an old BBC television comedy sketch series called <b>Monty Python's Flying Circus</b>
As the height of this success, the Monty Python team were performing their sketches to live audiences across the world, including at the Hollywood Bowl.
Since Monty Python is considered one of the two fundamental nutrients to a programmer (the other being pizza), Python's creater named the language in honour of the TV show.

## Why Python?
* Python works on different platforms.
* Python syntax is similar to English.
* Python code is of fewer lines.
* Python can be treated in a Procedural Programming way.

## Where can we see Python in action?
We see it everyday and almost everywhere. It's used extenssively to implement complex <b>Internet services </b> like search engines, cloud storage and tools, social media and so on. Whenever you use any of these services, you are actually very close to Python, although you wouldn't know it.
Many <b> developing tools </b> are implemented in Python. More and more <b> everyday use applications </b> are being written in Python. Lots of <b> scientists </b> have abandoned expensive proprietary tools and switched to Python. Lots of IT project <b> testers </b> have started using Python to carry out repeatable test procedures. The list is long.
