# Python Identifiers
A Python Identifiers is a name used to identify a variable, function, class, module or other object. An identifier starts with a letter A to Z or a to z or an underscore ( _ ) followed by zero or more letters, underscores and digits (0 to 9).
<br>
Python doesnot allow punctuation characters such as &commat, $, and % within identifiers. Python is a case sensitive programming language. Thus, Manpower and manpower are two different identifiers in Python.
<br>
Here are naming conventions for Python identifiers - <br>
* Class names with an upercase letter. All other identifiers start with the lowercase letter. <br>
* Starting an identifier with a single leading underscore indicates that the identifier is private. <br>
* Statrting an identifier with two leading underscores indicates a strongly private identifier. <br>
* If the identifier also ends with two trailing underscores, the identifier is a language - defined special name.

# Reserved Words
