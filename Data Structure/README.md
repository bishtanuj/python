# _Data Structures_

> ***As name suggests, it is a way of organizing and storing data in memory in such manner that we can perform operations on the stored data more efficiently.***

To structure the data many algorithms were proposed, which are known as **abstract data type.**

## There are two types of data structures
* Primitive Data Structure
* Non-primitive Data Structure

### Primitive Data Structure
These are primitive data types which can hold the single value. For example: int, char, float, double.

### Non-primitive Data Structure
These are further divided into two parts:
- Linear Data Strucutre
&emsp; - Non - Linear Data Structure
