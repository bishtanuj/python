# _Data Structures_

> ***As name suggests, it is a way of organizing and storing data in memory in such manner that we can perform operations on the stored data more efficiently.***

To structure the data many algorithms were proposed, which are known as **abstract data type.**

## There are two types of data structures
* Primitive Data Structure
* Non-primitive Data Structure

### Primitive Data Structure
These are primitive data types which can hold the single value. For example: int, char, float, double.

### Non-primitive Data Structure
These are further divided into two parts:
- Linear Data Strucutre
- Non - Linear Data Structure

#### Linear Data Structure
- It is a type of data structure where the arrangement of data is such that the each element is directly connected to its previous and next elements. <br> For example: Array, Linked List, Queue, Stack.
- All the elements in the linear data structure can be traversed in single run.

#### Non - Linear Data Structure
- It is a type of data structure where the arrangement of data is such that the each element is directly connected with more than one element. <br> For example: Trees, Graphs.
- All the elements in the non - linear data structure can not be traversed in a single run.

### Data Structure can also be classified as:
1. Static Data Structure
2. Dyna,ic Data Structure
