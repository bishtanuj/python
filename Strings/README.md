# Strings

_Strings in python are surrounded by either single quotation marks, or double quotation marks._

`'hello'` is the same as `"hello"`

You can display the string with the `print()` function:
```md
print('Hello')
print("Hello")
```

You can use `input()` function to scan the string from user through console:
```md
string = input("Enter the string: ")
print(string)
```
