# _BUBBLE SORT_

It is a sorting algorithm, works on the repeatedly swapping of adjacent elements until they are not in the intended order. It is called bubble sort because the movement of array elements is just like the movement of air bubbles in the water. Bubbles in water rises up to the surface, similarly, the elements of the array in bubble sort moves to end in each iteration.
