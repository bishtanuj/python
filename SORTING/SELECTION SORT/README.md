# _SELECTION SORT_

_Selection sort is the technique of sorting, that selects the smallest element and insert that smallest element of the unsorted array to its appropriate position in every pass._

_In selection sort, the first smallest element is selected from the unsorted array and placed at the first position. After that second smallest element is selected and placed in the second position. The process continues until the array is entirely sorted._
