# _SORTING_
_Arranging elements in a specific order either in ascending or in descending order is known as sorting._

## Some Important Terminologies
### INPLACE SORT
_Extra space required in range between_ $O(1)$ _to_ $O(logn)$ _including_ $O(logn)$.<br>
$Example: Bubble, Selection, Insertion, Heap sort etc.$

### STABLE SORT
_The order of the repeated elements is not changed after sorting, then that sorting is called stable sort._ <br>
Example: Bubble, Insertion, Merge, Counting, Radix sort etc.
