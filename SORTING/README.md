# SORTING
Arranging elements in a specific order either in ascending or in descending order is known as sorting.

## Some Important Terminologies
### INPLACE SORT
Extra space required in range between O(1) to O(logn) including O(logn).<br>
Example: Bubble, Selection, Insertion, Heap sort etc.

### STABLE SORT
The order of the repeated elements is not changed after sorting, then that sorting is called stable sort. <br>
Example: Bubble, Insertion, Merge, Counting, Radix sort etc.
