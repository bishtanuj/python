# Python Operators

**In computer science, an operator is a character that determines the action that is to be performed or considered.**

Python divides the operators in the following groups:
* Arithmetic Operators
* Assignment Operators
* Comparison Operators
* Logical Operators
* Identity Operators
* Membership Operators
* Bitwise Operators

## Arithmetic Operators
**An arithmetic operators are used with numeric values to perform common mathematical opertations:** <br>
| **Operators** | **Name** | **Example** | **Program** |
| :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: |
| + | Addition | a + b | [addition.py](https://github.com/bishtanuj/python/blob/main/Operators/addition.py) |
| - | Subtraction | a - b | [subtraction.py](https://github.com/bishtanuj/python/blob/main/Operators/subtraction.py) |
| * | Multiplication | a * b | [multiplication.py](https://github.com/bishtanuj/python/blob/main/Operators/multiplication.py) |
| / | Division | a / b | [division.py](https://github.com/bishtanuj/python/blob/main/Operators/division.py) |
| // | Floor Division | a // b | [floor_division.py](https://github.com/bishtanuj/python/blob/main/Operators/floor_division.py) |
| % | Modulus | a % b | [modulus.py](https://github.com/bishtanuj/python/blob/main/Operators/modulus.py) |
| ** | Exponentiation | a ** b | [exponentation.py](https://github.com/bishtanuj/python/blob/main/Operators/exponentation.py) |

## Assignment Operators
**An assignment operator is the operator used to assign a new value to a variable.** <br>
| **Operators** | **Example** | **Same As** | **Program** |
| :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: |
| = | a = 0 | a = 0 | |
| += | a += 5 | a = a + 5 | |
| -= | a -= 5 | a = a - 5 | |
| *= | a *= 5 | a = a * 5 | | 
| /= | a /= 5 | a = a / 5 | |
| %= | a %= 5 | a = a % 5 | |
| //= | a //= 5 | a = a // 5 | |
| **= | a **= 5 | a = a ** 5 | |
| &= | a &= 5 | a = a & 5 | |
| |= | a |= 5 | a = a | 5 | |
