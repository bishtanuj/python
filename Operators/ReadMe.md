# Python Operators

**In computer science, an operator is a character that determines the action that is to be performed or considered.**

Python divides the operators in the following groups:
* Arithmetic Operators
* Assignment Operators
* Comparison Operators
* Logical Operators
* Identity Operators
* Membership Operators
* Bitwise Operators

## Arithmetic Operators
**An arithmetic operators are used with numeric values to perform common mathematical opertations:** <br>
| **Operators** | **Name** | **Example** | **Program** |
| :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: |
| + | Addition | a + b | [addition.py](https://github.com/bishtanuj/python/blob/main/Operators/addition.py) |
| - | Subtraction | a - b | [subtraction.py](https://github.com/bishtanuj/python/blob/main/Operators/subtraction.py) |
| * | Multiplication | a * b | [multiplication.py](https://github.com/bishtanuj/python/blob/main/Operators/multiplication.py) |
| / | Division | a / b | [division.py](https://github.com/bishtanuj/python/blob/main/Operators/division.py) |
| // | Floor Division | a // b | [floor_division.py](https://github.com/bishtanuj/python/blob/main/Operators/floor_division.py) |
| % | Modulus | a % b | [modulus.py](https://github.com/bishtanuj/python/blob/main/Operators/modulus.py) |
| ** | Exponentiation | a ** b | [exponentation.py](https://github.com/bishtanuj/python/blob/main/Operators/exponentation.py) |

## Assignment Operators
**An assignment operator is the operator used to assign a new value to a variable.** <br>
| **S.No.** | **Operators** | **Example** | **Same As** | **Program** |
| :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: |
| 1. | = | a = 0 | a = 0 | |
| 2. | += | a += 5 | a = a + 5 | |
| 3. | -= | a -= 5 | a = a - 5 | |
| 4. | *= | a *= 5 | a = a * 5 | | 
| 5. | /= | a /= 5 | a = a / 5 | |
| 6. | %= | a %= 5 | a = a % 5 | |
| 7. | //= | a //= 5 | a = a // 5 | |
| 8. | **= | a **= 5 | a = a ** 5 | |
| 9. | &= | a &= 5 | a = a & 5 | |
| 10. | ^= | a ^= 5 | a = a ^ 5 | |
| 11. | >>= | a >>= 5 | a = a >> 5 | |
| 12. | <<= | a <<= 5 | a = a << 5 | |

## Comparison Operators
**Comparison operators can compare numbers or strings and perform evaluations. Expressions that use comparison operators do not return a number value as do arithmetic expressions. Comparison expressions returns either 1, which represents true or 0, which represents false.** <br>
| **Operator** | **Name** | **Example** | **Program** |
| :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: |
| == | Equal | a == b | |
| != | Not Equal | a != b | |
| > | Greater Than | a > b | |
| < | Less Than | a < b | |
| >= | Greater Than or Equal To | a >= b | |
| <= | Less Than or Equal To | a <= b | |
