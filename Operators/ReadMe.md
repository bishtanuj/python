# Python Operators

**In computer science, an operator is a character that determines the action that is to be performed or considered.**

Python divides the operators in the following groups:
* Arithmetic Operators
* Assignment Operators
* Comparison Operators
* Logical Operators
* Identity Operators
* Membership Operators
* Bitwise Operators

## Arithmetic Operators
**An arithmetic operators are used with numeric values to perform common mathematical opertations:** <br>
| **Operators** | **Name** | **Example** | **Program** |
| :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: |
| + | Addition | a + b | [addition.py](https://github.com/bishtanuj/python/blob/main/Operators/addition.py) |
| - | Subtraction | a - b | [subtraction.py](https://github.com/bishtanuj/python/blob/main/Operators/subtraction.py) |
| * | Multiplication | a * b | [multiplication.py](https://github.com/bishtanuj/python/blob/main/Operators/multiplication.py) |
| / | Division | a / b | |
| // | Floor Division | a // b | |
| % | Modulus | a % b | |
| ** | Exponentiation | a ** b | |
